> An app to improve access to mental health, built on top of Elarian.

## Theme: Overcoming Todayâ€™s Challenges For A Better Tomorrow

- Given the rise in depression levels in the country, accessibility to mental health resources and help fits in well with this theme. The aim of this demo is to try and improve access to things like mental health professionals, helplines etc in a safe space.

## Thought process

This app enables users to:
- Get health professionals near them
- Schedule for sessions if necessary
- Get reminders about sessions. (TODO)

## Requirements

- Node.js v12+

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm run build

# Copy default config and populate with your credentials.
$ cp config/default.json config/development.json

# Run the app
$ npm run app

# Once the app is running, you can simulate a user interacting with it via Elarian's simulator.
$ npm run simulate

```
